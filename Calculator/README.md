# Calculator App

in this react calculator project, I have learnt and implemented/used following concepts-
1 Props for passing Data from Parent to Child
2 State for storing data in local components, after re-rendering. for Creating State I used useState Hook.
3 Map method for mapping and displaying array data
4 Event Handling and communication from Child component to Parent component is also done with function as props
