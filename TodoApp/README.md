# React Projects

in this project Todo App, I have used learnt and implemented following concepts:

-1 UseState for State management or Storing Data after re-render
-2 ContextAPI for props drilling or cross components communication or to solve parent to child communication, child can directly access data from context.
-3 React ICons for using diffent icons
-4 useRef hook to get value of an input component
